# Architecture Overview and API Specification

## Architecture Overview

Our trading platform architecture is designed for high performance, scalability, and flexibility, leveraging the strengths of multiple technologies.

### Key Components

1. **Core API Service (Go)**
   - Handles user authentication, account management, and portfolio operations
   - Provides high-performance, low-latency REST APIs
   - Integrates with database and caching layers

2. **Trading Strategy Service (Python)**
   - Implements and manages trading strategies
   - Exposes strategy-related operations via FastAPI
   - Integrates with the Core API Service for account and portfolio data

3. **Data ETL Service (Java)**
   - Processes and transforms market data
   - Streams processed data to Kafka topics

4. **Order Execution Service (Rust)**
   - Handles the execution of trading orders
   - Integrated with the Python trading library

5. **Kafka Event Stream**
   - Central event bus for real-time data flow
   - Enables event-driven architecture across services

6. **Database Layer**
   - PostgreSQL for persistent storage
   - Utilizes connection pooling for efficient data access

7. **Caching Layer**
   - Redis for high-speed data caching
   - Reduces database load and improves response times

8. **Custom Logging Service**
   - Centralized logging solution leveraging Zap
   - Aggregates logs from all microservices
   - Enhances system observability

### Data Flow

1. Market data is processed by the Data ETL Service and streamed to Kafka topics.
2. Trading Strategy Service consumes relevant Kafka topics to inform strategy decisions.
3. When a trading signal is generated, the Trading Strategy Service communicates with the Core API Service to check account status and portfolio positions.
4. If a trade is to be executed, the Core API Service interacts with the Order Execution Service.
5. The Order Execution Service executes the trade and sends confirmation back through the system.
6. All services log activities to stdout, which are collected and processed by the Custom Logging Service.

### Security

- JWT-based authentication for inter-service communication
- HTTPS for all external API endpoints
- Rate limiting and IP whitelisting for API access control

### Scalability

- Horizontal scaling of services using Kubernetes
- Database read replicas for scaling read operations
- Kafka partitioning for parallel processing of market data streams
